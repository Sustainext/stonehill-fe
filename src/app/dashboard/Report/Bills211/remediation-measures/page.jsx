          ABC has taken several remediation measures to address forced and child
          labour in its supply chains. These include providing support and
          compensation to affected workers and their families, offering
          workforce reintegration and psychosocial assistance. The company has
          strengthened its auditing processes and implemented a robust grievance
          mechanism for reporting violations. Additionally, ABC has taken steps
          to prevent future occurrences by enhancing supplier training and
          enforcing a strict Supplier Code of Conduct. Formal apologies have
          been issued where necessary, demonstrating ABCâ€™s commitment to ethical
          labour practices
