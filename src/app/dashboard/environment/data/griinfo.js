              Energy intensity ratios define energy consumption in the context
              of an organization-specific metric. These ratios express the
              energy required per unit of activity, output, or any other
              organization specific metric. Intensity ratios are often called
              normalized environmental impact data.In combination with the
              organizationâ€™s total energy consumption, reported in Disclosures
              reported in Disclosures 302-1 and 302-2, energy intensity helps to
              contextualize the organizationâ€™s efficiency, including in relation
              to other organizations.

              Water quality refers to the physical, chemical, biological, and

              a human right. Water quality standards help uphold water quality
              in order to protect ecosystems, wildlife, and human health and
              welfare, and can be based on water properties, such as temperature
              or pH value. The specific choice of water quality standards and
              parameters can vary depending on an organizationâ€™s product,
              services, and facility locations, and can depend on national
              and/or regional regulations, as well as the profile of the
              receiving waterbody.

              Water stress refers to the ability, or lack thereof, to meet the
              human and ecological demand for water. Water stress can refer to
              the availability, quality, or accessibility of water. Publicly
              available and credible tools for assessing areas with water stress
              include the World Resources Institute â€˜Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas,'
              and the WWF 'Water Risk Filter'. Based on these tools, water
              stress in an area may be assessed using either of the following
              indicators and their thresholds:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
              <li className="text-[11px] text-[#727272]">
                he ratio of total annual water withdrawal to total available
                annual renewable water supply (i.e., baseline water stress) is
                high (40-80%) or extremely high (&lt; 80%)
              </li>
              <li className="text-[11px] text-[#727272]">
                he ratio of water consumption-to-availability (i.e., water
                depletion) is moderate (dry-year depletion, where for at least
                10% of the time, the monthly depletion ratio is &gt;75%), high
                (seasonal depletion, where for one month of the year on average,
                the depletion ratio is &gt;75%), or very high (ongoing
                depletion, where the depletion ratio on average is &gt;75%)
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-[11px] text-[#727272] mb-2">
              The organization may use these indicators even though they account
              only for quantity and not the quality or accessibility of water as
              per the inclusive approach to the definition of water stress. The
              organization can complement the results from these tools with
              their own assessments, to provide more granular local-level data.
              Water stress in an area may be measured at catchment level at a
              minimum.

              Quantifying the volume of water discharge can help an organization
              understand its negativeimpacts on the receiving waterbody. The
              relationship between water discharge and negative impacts is not
              linear. An increase in the total volume of water discharge does
              not necessarily correspond to greater negative impacts, since
              these impacts depend on the quality of the water discharge and the
              sensitivity of the receiving waterbody. An organization with a
              high volume of water discharge, but also a high level of treatment
              and strict quality standards, can have positive impacts on the
              receiving waterbody. To learn more about locations where
              water-related impacts might be significant, and where actions to
              address them are most needed, the reporting organization can also
              report the information requested in Disclosure 303-4 for each

              change in water storage using the following formula: Change in
              water storage = Total water storage at the end of the reporting
              period - Total water storage at the beginning of the reporting

              community in the reporting period. Reporting the volume of water
              consumption can help the organization understand the overall scale
              of its impact due to water withdrawal on downstream water

              some of its business relationships (e.g., they apply only to
              suppliers), then the organization should report to which
              activities and business relationships the policies or commitments
              apply. It can also explain why the policies or commitments are
              limited to these activities and business relationships.

              commitments, or are encouraged (but not obligated) to do so. When
              its business relationships are encouraged to abide by the policies

              net gain of biodiversity, or to contribute to nature positive
              goals. In such a case, the organization should explain how it has

              reporting progress toward the goals and targets and assessing if
              the progress is satisfactory, the organization can, for example,
              report that it sourced 60% of deforestation-free products in 2023.

              impacts are taken. Impacts can be avoided by finding alternative
              locations for the activities (e.g., relocating the site), changing
              the timing of the activities (e.g., timing activities when they do
              not interfere with a species' breeding or migration), or by

              is the process of assisting the recovery of an ecosystem that has

              process of stabilizing the terrain, ensuring public safety,
              enhancing aesthetics, and restoring the land to a purpose deemed
              useful within the regional context. Actions taken to restore and
              rehabilitate affected ecosystems aim to return the environment to
              its original state or to a state where it has a healthy and
              functioning ecosystem.

              the area targeted for restoration or rehabilitation is equivalent
              in size to the area that has been affected. â€˜Viableâ€™ means that no

              restoration and rehabilitation is that the land ownership is not
              limited in time. â€™Measurableâ€™ means that objectives have been
              defined and are regularly monitored. Stakeholder engagement can
              include co-design, co-management, co-governance, and regular and

              conservation outcomes are demonstrably new and additional and
              would not have resulted without the offset (e.g., weed control
              measures required by legislation cannot contribute to an offset).
              As no two areas are ecologically identical, â€˜ecological
              equivalenceâ€™ means that the biodiversity gains from the offset
              must be equivalent to the residual impacts. â€˜Permanenceâ€™ means
              that the offsets must provide biodiversity gains that correspond
              to the duration of the biodiversity loss from the residual impacts

              Requirement 101-2-d provides information about which sites with
              the most significant impacts on biodiversity have a biodiversity
              management plan. The sites with the most significant impacts are
              those reported under 101-5-a.

              A biodiversity management plan describes how the actions to manage
              biodiversity impacts are implemented within a particular site. It
              includes a monitoring plan, a time schedule, milestones, and
              targets. The plans to manage biodiversity impacts may be
              integrated into broader site environmental management plans.

              Synergies include actions taken to protect biodiversity that
              contribute to climate change mitigation or adaptation. Actions can
              also improve the capacity of species or ecosystems to adapt to
              unavoidable climate change impacts. For example, planting
              mangroves can protect biodiversity by increasing the wildlife
              population and contribute to climate change mitigation and
              adaptation by capturing and storing carbon and controlling floods.

            <p className="text-[11px] text-[#727272] mb-2">
              In contrast, trade-offs include climate change mitigation or
              adaptation actions that result in biodiversity loss. For example,
              foresting an area with non-native species may contribute to
              climate change mitigation and adaptation by absorbing greenhouse
              gases and controlling erosion. However, it may also result in the
              loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services that flow from the
              affected ecosystems.

              If the organization does not enhance synergies or reduce
              trade-offs between actions taken to manage its biodiversity and
              climate change impacts, a brief statement of this fact is
              sufficient to comply with the requirement

              Actions taken to manage impacts on biodiversity may lead to
              negative impacts on stakeholders. For example, when an
              organizationâ€™s offset measures form a new protected area
              restricting the local community from using the area and accessing
              natural resources.

            <p className="text-[12px] text-[#727272] mb-2">
              The organization should report which stakeholders are affected or
              potentially affected and explain how it identifies, addresses, and
              monitors the negative and positive impacts on stakeholders. The
              organization should explain how it engages with stakeholders to
              identify and avoid negative impacts that are considered
              unacceptable and cannot be mitigated or compensated for. It should
              also describe the actions taken to achieve equitable social
              outcomes. For example, a privately owned protected area invests
              part of its revenue from tourism in local energy and healthcare
              projects, but it restricts local communities from utilizing the
              land for agricultural purposes. The organization should also
              explain how it engages with stakeholders and describe any conflict
              resolution or grievance mechanisms it has implemented. For more
