              An increase in the number or rate of reported incidents does not
              necessarily mean that there have been a greater number of
              incidents than before; it can indicate an improvement in the
              recording and reporting of incidents. If an increase in the number
              or rate of reported incidents is the result of the organization’s
              actions to improve the reporting and recording of fatalities,
              injuries, and ill health, or its actions to expand the scope of
              its management system to cover more workers or workplaces, the
              reporting organization can explain this and report on these
              actions and their results. Types of work-related injury can
              include death, amputation of a limb, laceration, fracture, hernia,
              burns, loss of consciousness, and paralysis, among others. In the
              context of this Standard, work-related musculoskeletal disorders
              are covered under ill health (and not injuries) and are to be
              reported using Disclosure 403-10. If the organization operates in
              a jurisdiction where worker compensation systems classify
              musculoskeletal disorders as injuries, the organization can
              explain this and report these disorders using Disclosure 403-9.
              Injuries involving members of the public as a result of a
              work-related incident are not included in this disclosure, but the
              organization can report this information separately. For example,
              the organization can report incidents where a vehicle driven by a
              worker causes the deaths of other road users or incidents where
              visitors are injured during their visit to the organization’s
              workplace.

              As per the definition of recordable work-related injury, the
              organization is required to report all work-related injuries as
              part of the ‘number and rate of recordable work-related injuries’.
              In addition, the organization is required to separately report
              high-consequence work- related injuries, with a breakdown by:

              The definition of ‘high-consequence work-related injury’ uses
              ‘recovery time’, instead of ‘lost time’, as the criterion for
              determining the severity of an injury. Lost time is an indicator
              of the loss of productivity for an organization as a result of a
              work-related injury; it does not necessarily indicate the extent
              of harm suffered by a worker.

            <p className="text-[11px] text-[#727272] mb-4">
              ‘Recovery time’, in contrast, refers to the time needed for a
              worker to recover fully to pre-injury health status; it does not
              refer to the time needed for a worker to return to work. In some

              of work-related injuries that resulted in lost-workday cases, the
              average number of lost days per lost-workday case, the number of
              lost workdays, and the absentee rate.

              This disclosure covers work-related hazards that pose a risk of
              high-consequence injury if not controlled, even when there are
              control measures in place. The hazards might have been identified
              proactively through risk assessment, or reactively as a result of
              either a high- potential incident or a high-consequence injury.
              Examples of work-related hazards causing or contributing to
              high-consequence injuries include excessive workload demands,
              tripping hazards, or exposure to flammable materials. If the
              identified work-related hazards vary significantly across
              different locations, the organization may group or disaggregate
              these by relevant categories, such as by geographical area or
              business line. Similarly, if there are a high number of hazards,
              the organization may group or categorize them to facilitate
              reporting. When reporting how it has determined which work-
              related hazards pose a risk of high-consequence injury using
              Disclosure 403-9-c-i, the organization can describe the criteria
              or threshold used to determine which hazards pose such a risk and
              which do not. The processes to identify hazards and assess risks,
              and to apply the hierarchy of controls, are reported using
              Disclosure 403-2-a.
              <b>Disclosure 403-9-c-ii</b> does not require reporting which
              work-related hazards have caused or contributed to which
              high-consequence injuries during the reporting period; it requires
              the aggregate analysis of all work- related hazards that resulted
              in high-consequence injuries. If a work-related incident resulting
              in a high-consequence injury is still under investigation at the
              end of the reporting period, the organization can state this in
              the report. The organization can report on actions taken during
              the reporting period to eliminate hazards and minimize risks that
              were identified, or to address work- related incidents that took
              place, in prior reporting periods.

              If the organization follows the ILO code of practice on Recording
              and notiflcation of occupational accidents and diseases, it can
              state this in response to Disclosure 403-9-g. If the organization
              does not follow the ILO code of practice, it can indicate which
              system of rules it applies in recording and reporting work-related
              injuries and its relationship to the ILO code of practice. If the
              organization cannot directly calculate the number of hours worked,
              it may estimate this on the basis of normal or standard hours of
              work, taking into account entitlements to periods of paid leave of
              absence from work (e.g., paid vacations, paid sick leave, public
              holidays) and explain this in the report. When the organization
              cannot directly calculate or estimate the number of hours worked
              (e.g., because the workers performed non-routine work during an
              emergency situation, or because the performed work was not paid
              for by the hour), it is required to provide a reason for this
              omission as set out in GRI 101: Foundation. See clause 3.2 in GRI

              Target 8.8 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals aims to
              ‘protect labour rights and promote safe and secure working
              environments for all workers, including migrant workers, in
              particular women migrants, and those in precarious employment’.
              Some groups might be at increased risk of work-related injury due
              to demographic factors such as sex, gender, migrant status, or
              age; it can thus be beneficial to break down data on work-related
              injuries by these demographic criteria. ILO Convention 143
              ‘Migrant Workers (Supplementary Provisions) Convention’ defines
              ‘migrant worker’ as ‘a person who migrates or who has migrated
              from one country to another with a view to being employed
              otherwise than on his own account and includes any person
              regularly admitted as a migrant worker’. If the data on

              injury (e.g., amputation, paralysis) or incident (e.g., explosion,

              Clause 2.1.3 requires the organization to include injuries as a

              been organized by the organization (e.g., company or contracted
              bus or vehicle). The organization can report other commuting

            <p className="text-[11px] text-[#727272] mb-4">
              Clause 2.1.4 requires the organization to calculate the rates
              based on either 200,000 or 1,000,000 hours worked. Standardized
              rates allow for meaningful comparisons of statistics, for example
              between different periods or organizations, or help account for
              differences in the number of workers in the reference group and
              the number of hours worked by them. A rate based on 200,000 hours
              worked indicates the number of work-related injuries per 100
              full-time workers over a one-year timeframe, based on the
              assumption that one full-time worker works 2,000 hours per year.
              For example, a rate of 1.0 means that, on average, there is one
              work-related injury for every group of 100 full-time workers over
              a one-year timeframe. A rate based on 1,000,000 hours worked
              indicates the number of work-related injuries per 500 full-time
              workers over a one-year timeframe. A rate based on 200,000 hours
              worked might be more suitable for small organizations. In addition
              to standardized rates, this disclosure requires the organization
              to report absolute data (i.e., numbers), to allow information
              users to calculate the rates themselves using other methodologies
              if needed.

              Work-related ill health can include acute, recurring, and chronic
              health problems caused or aggravated by work conditions or
              practices. They include musculoskeletal disorders, skin and
              respiratory diseases, malignant cancers, diseases caused by
              physical agents (e.g., noise-induced hearing loss,
              vibration-caused diseases), and mental illnesses (e.g., anxiety,

              This disclosure covers, but is not limited to, the diseases
              included in the ILO List of Occupational Diseases. In the context
              of this Standard, work-related musculoskeletal disorders are
              covered under ill health (and not injuries) and are to be reported
              using this disclosure. See references 5 and 16 in the References
              section.

            <p className="text-[11px] text-[#727272] mb-4">
              This disclosure covers all cases of work-related ill health
              notified to the reporting organization or identified by the
              organization through medical surveillance, during the reporting
              period. The organization might be notified of cases of
              work-related ill health through reports by affected workers,
              compensation agencies, or healthcare professionals. The disclosure
              may include cases of work-related ill health that were detected
              during the reporting period among former workers. If the
              organization determines, for example through investigation, that
              the notified case of work-related ill health is not due to
              exposure whilst working for the organization, it can explain this
              in the report.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[11px] text-[#727272] mb-4">
              This disclosure covers both short-latency and long- latency
              work-related ill health. Latency refers to the time period between
              exposure and the onset of ill health. Many cases of long-latency
              work-related ill health go undetected; if detected, they might not
              necessarily be due to exposures with one employer. For example, a
              worker might be exposed to asbestos while working for different
              employers over time, or might suffer from a long-latency disease
              that turns fatal many years after the worker has left the
              organization. For this reason, data on work-related ill health are
              to be complemented with information on work-related hazards. In
              some situations, an organization might not be able to collect or
              publicly disclose data on work-related ill health. The following
              are examples of these situations:
            </p>

                health insurance provisions, and other legal requirements
                related to the privacy of workers’ health-related information,
                might prevent organizations from collecting, maintaining, and
                publicly reporting these data.

              <li className="text-[11px] text-[#727272]">
                The nature of information on workers’ exposure to psychosocial
                factors, largely based on self-disclosure and in many instances
                protected under healthcare privacy regulations, might limit
                organizations in disclosing this information.
              </li>

              In these situations, the organization is required to provide a
              reason for omission of these data as set out in GRI 101:
              Foundation. See clause 3.2 in GRI 101 for requirements on reasons
              for omission. Cases of ill health involving members of the public
              as a result of a work-related incident are not included in this
              disclosure, but the organization can report this information
              separately. An example of such an incident is when a chemical
              substance spill causes ill health among members of a nearby
              community.

              A key element in managing impacts on people in local communities
              is assessment and planning in order to understand the actual and
              potential impacts, and strong engagement with local communities to
              understand their expectations and needs. There are many elements
              that can be incorporated into local community engagement, impact
              assessments, and development programs. This disclosure seeks to
              identify which elements have been consistently applied,
              organization-wide.  Where possible, organizations are expected to
              anticipate and avoid negative impacts on local communities. Where
              this is not possible, or where residual impacts remain,
              organizations are expected to manage those impacts appropriately,
              including grievances, and to compensate local communities for
              negative impacts. 
            </p>
            <p className="text-[11px] text-[#727272] mb-4">
              Establishing a timely and effective stakeholder identification and
              engagement process is important to help organizations understand
              the vulnerability of local communities and how these might be
              affected by the organization’s activities. A stakeholder
              engagement process both in early planning stages as well as during
              operations, can help establish lines of communication between an
              organization’s various departments (planning, finance,
              environment, production, etc.) and key stakeholder interest groups
              in the community. This enables an organization to consider the
              views of community stakeholders in its decisions, and to address
              its potential impacts on local communities in a timely manner. 
            </p>
            <p className="text-[11px] text-[#727272] mb-4">
              Organizations can utilize a number of useful tools to engage
              communities, including social and human rights impact assessments,
              which include a diverse set of approaches for proper
              identification of stakeholders and community characteristics.
              These can be based on issues such as ethnic background, indigenous
              descent, gender, age, migrant status, socioeconomic status,
              literacy levels, disabilities, income level, infrastructure
              availability or specific human health vulnerabilities which may
              exist within stakeholder communities.

            <p className="text-[11px] text-[#727272] mb-4">
              An organization is expected to consider the differentiated nature
              of local communities and to take specific action to identify and
              engage vulnerable groups. This might require adopting
              differentiated measures to allow the effective participation of
              vulnerable groups, such as making information available in
              alternate languages or format for those who are not literate or
              who do not have access to printed materials. Where necessary,
              organizations are expected to establish additional or separate
              processes so that negative impacts on vulnerable or disadvantaged
              groups are avoided, minimized, mitigated or compensated

            <p className="text-[11px] text-[#727272] mb-4">
              The purpose of this disclosure is to identify an organization’s
              support for political causes. This disclosure can provide an
              indication of the extent to which an organization’s political
              contributions are in line with its stated policies, goals, or
              other public positions. Direct or indirect contributions to
              political causes can also present corruption risks, because they
              can be used to exert undue influence on the political process.
              Many countries have legislation that limits the amount an
              organization can spend on political parties and candidates for
              campaigning purposes. If an organization channels contributions
              indirectly through intermediaries, such as lobbyists or
              organizations linked to political causes, it can improperly
              circumvent such legislation.

              the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
              OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, organizations are
              expected to ‘respect consumer privacy and take reasonable measures
              to ensure the security of personal data that they collect, store,
              process or disseminate’. To protect customer privacy, an
              organization is expected to limit its collection of personal data,
              to collect data by lawful means, and to be transparent.

              The precautionary principle is set out in Principle 15 of the UN
              Rio Declaration on Environment and Development [18]. It states:
              ‘Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack
              of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for
              postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental
              degradation.’

            <p className="text-[11px] text-[#727272] mb-4">
              The precautionary principle means taking early action to prevent
              and mitigate potential negative impacts in situations where
              conclusive scientific understanding or evidence is lacking, but
              there is sufficient reason to expect serious or irreversible
              damage.

              While the precautionary principle is most often associated with
              the protection of the environment, it can be applied to other
              areas, such as health and safety. The organization can describe
              the areas where it applies the precautionary principle.

              The internationally recognized human rights include, at a minimum,
              the rights set out in the UN International Bill of Human Rights

              If the policy commitment covers all internationally recognized
              human rights, a brief statement of this fact is sufficient to
              comply with the requirement. The organization can also state if
              the policy commitment references certain rights that require
              particular attention. For example, an organization can state that
              its policy commitment covers all internationally recognized human
              rights, and also references the rights to privacy and freedom of
              expression in particular because the organization has identified
              that its activities have an impact on these rights.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[11px] text-[#727272] mb-4">
              If the policy commitment covers only some internationally
              recognized human rights, the organization is required to state the
              rights that are covered. It can explain why the policy commitment
              is limited to these rights.

            <p className="text-[11px] text-[#727272] mb-4">
              Categories of stakeholders that the organization gives particular
              attention to can include consumers, customers, employees and other
              workers, and local communities. They can also include individuals
              belonging to groups or populations that are considered to be at
              risk or vulnerable groups, such as children; human rights
              defenders; indigenous peoples; migrant workers and their families;
              national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities; persons
              who might be discriminated against based on their sexual
              orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or sex
              characteristics; persons with disabilities; or women.

            <p className="text-[11px] text-[#727272] mb-4">
              For example, a bank may give particular attention in its policy
              commitment to avoid discriminating against specific categories of
              customers, or a mining organization may give particular attention
              to avoid infringing on the rights of indigenous peoples.

              The most senior level may differ between organizations. For
              example, the most senior level in an organization could be the
              highest governance body (e.g., the board) or the most senior
              executive (e.g., chief executive officer).
            </p>
            <p className="text-[11px] text-[#727272] mb-4">
              The organization can also report the dates of approval and
              adoption of the policy commitments, and how frequently the
              commitments are reviewed.

              If the policy commitments apply to all of the organization’s
              activities and business relationships equally, a brief statement
              of this fact is sufficient to comply with the requirement. If the
              policy commitments apply to only some of the organization’s
              activities (e.g., they apply only to entities located in certain
              countries or to certain subsidiaries), the organization should
              report which activities the commitments apply to. It can also
              explain why the commitments are limited to these activities. If
              the policy commitments apply to only some of the organization’s
              business relationships, the organization should specify the types
              of business relationships the commitments apply to (e.g.,
              distributors, franchisees, joint ventures, suppliers). It can also
              explain why the commitments are limited to these business
              relationships. The organization should also explain whether the
              business relationships are obligated to abide by the policy
              commitments or are encouraged (but not obligated) to do so.

            This disclosure covers all employees as reported under Disclosure
            2-7 in this Standard.
            <br />
            <br />
            Annual total compensation includes salary, bonus, stock awards,
            option awards, non-equity incentive plan compensation, change in
            pension value, and nonqualified deferred compensation earnings
            provided over the course of a year. When calculating the ratio, the
            organization should, depending on the organization’s remuneration
            policies and availability of data, consider all of the following:
            <br />• Base salary, which is the sum of guaranteed, short-term, and
            non-variable cash compensation.
            <br />• Total cash compensation, which is the sum of the base salary
            and cash allowances, bonuses, commissions, cash profit-sharing, and
            other forms of variable cash payments.
            <br />• Direct compensation, which is the sum of total cash
            compensation and total fair value of all annual long-term incentives
            (e.g., stock option awards, restricted stock shares or units,
            performance stock shares or units, phantom stock shares, stock
            appreciation rights, and long-term cash awards).
            <br />
            <br />
            The annual total compensation ratio can be calculated using the
            following formula:
            <br />
            (Annual total compensation for the organization's highest
            paid-individual / Median annual total compensation for all of the
            organization's employees excluding the highest-paid individual)
            <br />
            <br />
            The change in the annual total compensation ratio can be calculated
            using the following formula:
            <br />
            (Percentage increase in annual total compensation for the
            organization's highest-paid individual / Median percentage increase
            in annual total compensation for all of the organization's employees
            excluding the highest-paid individual)

              This disclosure covers the organization’s mechanisms for
              individuals to seek advice and raise concerns about responsible
              business conduct in the organization's operations and business
              relationships. Examples of these mechanisms include confidential
              interviews during site visits, escalation processes (to raise
              issues through management levels), hotlines, mechanisms to report
              non-compliance with laws and regulations, and whistleblowing
              mechanisms.
              <br />
              <br />
              These mechanisms enable individuals to raise concerns about
              wrongdoing or breaches of the law in the organization’s operations
              or business relationships, regardless of whether the individuals
              themselves are harmed or not. They are distinct from grievance
              mechanisms, which enable stakeholders to raise concerns about, and
              seek remedy / remediation for, the organization’s potential and
              actual negative impacts on them. Grievance mechanisms are reported
              under Disclosure 2-25 in this Standard.
              <br />
              <br />
              If the organization’s grievance mechanisms and its mechanisms for
              seeking advice and raising concerns about responsible business
              conduct operate in a similar way, the organization can provide a
              single description of how these mechanisms operate and explain
              which mechanisms the description covers.
              <br />
              <br />
              The organization can report:
              <br />• who the intended users of the mechanisms are;
              <br />• how the mechanisms operate and which level or function in
              the organization is assigned responsibility for them;
              <br />• whether the mechanisms are operated independently of the
              organization (e.g., by a third party);
              <br />• the process through which concerns are investigated;
              <br />• whether requests for advice and concerns raised are
              treated confidentially;
              <br />• whether the mechanisms can be used anonymously.
              <br />
              <br />
              Additionally, the organization can report information about the
              effectiveness of the mechanisms, including:
              <br />• whether and how the intended users are informed about the
              mechanisms and trained on how to use them;
              <br />• the accessibility of the mechanisms, such as the number of
              hours per day or days per week they are available, and their
              availability in different languages;
              <br />• how the organization seeks to ensure it respects users’
              human rights and protects them against reprisals (i.e.,
              non-retaliation for raising concerns);
              <br />• how satisfied users are with the mechanisms and with the
              resulting outcomes;
              <br />• the number and types of requests for advice received
              during the reporting period, and the percentage of requests that
              were answered;
              <br />• the number and types of concerns raised during the
              reporting period, and the percentage of concerns that were
              addressed and resolved or found to be unsubstantiated.

              Grievance mechanisms refer to any routinized, state-based or
              non-state-based, judicial or nonjudicial processes through which
              stakeholders can raise grievances and seek remedy. Examples of
              state-based judicial and non-judicial grievance mechanisms include
              courts (for both criminal and civil actions), labor tribunals,
              national human rights institutions, National Contact Points under
              the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, ombudsperson
              offices, consumer protection agencies, regulatory oversight
              bodies, and government-run complaints offices. Non-state-based
              grievance mechanisms include those administered by the
              organization, either alone or together with stakeholders, such as
              operational-level grievance mechanisms and collective bargaining,
              including the mechanisms established by collective bargaining.
              They also include mechanisms administered by industry
              associations, international organizations, civil society
              organizations, or multi-stakeholder groups. Operational-level
              grievance mechanisms are administered by the organization either
              alone or in collaboration with other parties and are directly
              accessible by the organization’s stakeholders. They allow for
              grievances to be identified and addressed early and directly,
              thereby preventing both harm and grievances from escalating. They
              also provide important feedback on the effectiveness of the
              organization’s due diligence from those who are directly affected.

              The organization should provide a restatement of information when
              it has learned that the previously reported information needs to
              be revised. Restatements of information from previous reporting
              periods can correct an error, or account for changes in
              measurement methodology or to the nature of the business.
              Restatements of information ensure consistency and enable
              comparability of information between reporting periods. The
              organization should report the criteria used to determine when a
              change or error in previously reported information is considered
              significant enough to provide a restatement. A change or error
              could be significant when it influences information users’
              decision-making (e.g., it influences the analysis of the changes
              in the organization’s impacts over time). For example, if an
              organization adopts a new, more accurate method for measuring
              greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, it may subsequently experience a
              reduction in its previously reported GHG emissions that meets the
              organization’s restatement criteria. The organization then
              restates its previously reported GHG emissions. In such a case,
              the organization is required to explain that it has restated its
              previously reported GHG emissions due to the new measurement
              methodology and that this has resulted in lower GHG emissions than
              previously reported. The organization should also report the
              quantitative change observed (e.g., GHG emissions are 10% lower
              than the emissions previously reported). If the organization has
              not made any restatement in the reporting period, a brief
              statement of this fact is sufficient to comply with the
              requirement.

              The effect of the restatement refers to the consequences of the
              change or correction made to previously reported information. If
              the restatement relates to quantitative information, the
              organization should specify the quantitative change in the

              the number of individual employees, whether full-time or part-time
              employed. Reporting these numbers in FTE gives insight into the
              hours worked. The organization can use another methodology for
              reporting these numbers. Reporting the number of employees at the
              end of the reporting period provides information for that point in
              time, without capturing fluctuations during the reporting period.

              takes into account fluctuations during the reporting period.

              Quantitative data, such as the number of temporary or part-time
              employees, is unlikely to be sufficient on its own. For example, a
              high proportion of temporary or part-time employees could indicate
              lack of employment security for employees, but it could equally
              signal workplace flexibility when offered as a voluntary choice.
              For this reason, the organization is required to report contextual
              information to help information users interpret the data. The
              organization can explain the reasons for temporary employment. An
              example of such a reason is the recruitment of employees to
              undertake work on a temporary or seasonal project or event.
              Another example is the standard practice to offer a temporary
              contract (e.g., six months) to new employees before an offer of
              permanent employment is made. The organization can also explain
              the reasons for non-guaranteed hours employment.

            <p className="text-[11px] text-[#727272] mb-2">
              The organization can explain how it defines full-time employment.
              If the organization has employees in more than one country, it can
              report the definitions of full-time employment it uses for the
              regions that cover these countries. The organization can also
              explain the reasons for part-time employment. Examples of such
              reasons are to accommodate employees’ requests to work reduced
              hours, or because the organization is unable to provide full-time
              employment to all employees. If there are differences in
              permanent, temporary, non-guaranteed hours, full-time, and
              part-time employment between genders or between regions, the
              organization can explain the reasons for these differences.

              increased or decreased). It can also include the reasons for the
              fluctuations. For example, an increase in the number of employees
              during the reporting period could be due to a seasonal event.
              Conversely, a decrease in the number of employees compared to the

              This disclosure provides insights into how the organization

              Collective Bargaining Convention [8].

            <p className="text-[11px] text-[#727272] mb-2">
              Collective bargaining refers to negotiations that take place
              between one or more employers or employers' organizations and one
              or more workers' organizations (e.g., trade unions). The objective
              of these negotiations is to reach a collective agreement on
              working conditions and terms of employment (e.g., wages, working
              time) and to regulate relations between employers and workers. [3]
              These negotiations are an important means through which employers’
              organizations and workers’ organizations can improve working
              conditions and labor relations.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[11px] text-[#727272] mb-2">
              Collective agreements can be made at the level of the
              organization, at the level of a particular site, at the industry
              level, and at the national level in countries where this is the
              practice. Collective agreements can cover specific groups of
              workers, for example, those performing a specific activity or
              working at a specific location.

              If the organization has a statement or policy commitment on
              freedom of association and collective bargaining, this is reported
              under 2-23-b-i in this Standard or 3-3-c in GRI 3: Material Topics
              2021.

            <p className="text-[11px] text-[#727272] mb-4">
              The organization is required to report the percentage of its
              employees whose working conditions and terms of employment are
              regulated by one or more collective bargaining agreements. The
              percentage of employees covered by collective bargaining
              agreements is calculated using the following formula: (Number of
              employees covered by collective bargaining agreements / Total
              number of employees reported under 2-7-a) * 100 The employees
              covered by collective bargaining agreements are those employees to
              whom the organization is obligated to apply the agreement. This
              means that if none of the employees are covered by a collective
              bargaining agreement, the percentage reported is zero. An employee
              covered by more than one collective bargaining agreement only
              needs to be counted once. This requirement does not ask for the
              percentage of employees represented by a works council or
              belonging to trade unions, which can be different. The percentage
              of employees covered by collective bargaining agreements can be
              higher than the percentage of unionized employees when the
              collective bargaining agreements apply to both union and non-union
              members. Alternatively, the percentage of employees covered by
              collective bargaining agreements can be lower than the percentage
              of unionized employees. This may be the case when there are no
              collective bargaining agreements available or when the collective
              bargaining agreements do not cover all unionized employees. The
              organization can also provide a breakdown of the percentage of
              employees covered by collective bargaining agreements by region,
              or provide comparisons with industry benchmarks.

              There may be instances where collective bargaining agreements
              cover some or none of the organization’s employees. However, the
              working conditions and terms of employment of these employees may
              be influenced or determined by the organization based on other
              collective bargaining agreements, such as agreements that cover
              other employees or agreements from other organizations. If this is
              the case, the organization is required to report it under 2-30-b.

              based on other collective bargaining agreements, a brief statement

              The impacts of infrastructure investment can extend beyond the

              operations, this is one measure of the organization’s capital

              Information on the creation and distribution of economic value
              provides a basic indication of how an organization has created
              wealth for stakeholders. Several components of the economic value
              generated and distributed (EVG&D) also provide an economic profile
              of an organization, which can be useful for normalizing other
              performance figures. If presented in country-level detail, EVG&D
              can provide a useful picture of the direct monetary value added to
              local economies.

              plans, such as defined contribution plans, do not guarantee access
              to a retirement plan or the quality of the benefits. Thus, the
              type of plan chosen has implications for both employees and
              employers. Conversely, a properly funded pension plan can help to
              attract and maintain employees and support long-term financial and
              strategic planning on the part of the employer.

              corruption or the inclusion of corruption as a risk factor in
              overall risk assessments. The term ‘operation’ refers to a single

              single retail outlet can contain several different retail
              operations that are owned or managed by the organization.

              This disclosure pertains to legal actions initiated under national
              or international laws designed primarily for the purpose of
              regulating anti-competitive behavior, anti-trust, or monopoly
              practices. Anti-competitive behavior, anti-trust, and monopoly
              practices can affect consumer choice, pricing, and other factors
              that are essential to efficient markets. Legislation introduced in
              many countries seeks to control or prevent monopolies, with the
              underlying assumption that competition between enterprises also
              promotes economic efficiency and sustainable growth. Legal action
              indicates a situation in which the market actions or status of an
              organization have reached a sufficient scale to merit concern by a
              third party. Legal decisions arising from these situations can
              carry the risk of significant disruption of market activities for
              the organization as well as punitive measures.

              The reporting organization can illustrate its approach to tax by

              types of tax incentive it uses, or its approach to transfer
              pricing. These examples help demonstrate the organization’s risk
              appetite and the tax practices deemed acceptable and unacceptable
              by the organization and its highest governance body.

              If the organization has a tax strategy but the strategy is not

              organization has tax strategies that apply to individual entities
              or tax jurisdictions, the organization can explain any relevant
              differences between these strategies.

              tax laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates. For example,
              the organization can describe whether it seeks to comply with the

              organization takes reasonable steps to determine and follow the

              An organization’s approach to tax defines how the organization

              societal, and sustainable development-related expectations. It can
              include the organization’s tax principles, its attitude to tax
              planning, the degree of risk the organization is willing to
              accept, and the organization’s approach to engaging with tax
              authorities. An organization’s approach to tax is often described
              in a tax strategy, but it could also be described in equivalent
              documents, such as policies, standards, principles, or codes of
              conduct.

              include compliance risks or risks such as those related to
              uncertain tax positions, changes in legislation, or a perception
              of aggressive tax practices. When reporting on the approach to tax

              Unless otherwise stated, country-by-country information is to be
              reported at the level of tax jurisdictions and not at the level of
              individual entities. Number of employees, revenues, profit/loss
              before tax, and tangible assets other than cash and cash
              equivalents are indicators of the organization’s scale of activity
              within a tax jurisdiction. When considered in conjunction with the
              other required and recommended information, they can inform
              assessments about the level of taxes being paid in a jurisdiction.
              In addition to this information, the organization can report any
              other information relevant for understanding the scale of its
              activity within a jurisdiction. If the reporting organization
              cannot report all required information for all the tax
              jurisdictions reported in Disclosure 207-4-a, it may use reasons
              for omission as set out in GRI 1: Foundation 2021. The
              organization is required to specify the requirement it cannot
              comply with, and to provide a reason for omission and required
              explanation, as set out in GRI 1. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1 for
              more information on reasons for omission. If complete reporting
              for a tax jurisdiction is not possible because the organization
              holds a minority shareholding or is the non-operating joint
              venture partner in an entity, the organization may provide
              ‘information unavailable / incomplete’ as the reason for omission
              and specify the majority shareholder or operating partner. The
              organization can also report any contextual information necessary
              to understand how data has been compiled, such as any standards,
              methodologies, and assumptions used.

              When reporting its primary activities in a tax jurisdiction, the

              the jurisdiction, for example, sales, marketing, manufacturing, or
              distribution. The organization is not required to list the
              activities of each entity in the jurisdiction.

              Employee numbers can be reported using an appropriate calculation,
              such as head count at the end of the time period reported in
              Disclosure 207-4-c or a full-time equivalent (FTE) calculation. To
              enable comparability, it is important that the organization
              applies the approach consistently across all tax jurisdictions and
              between time periods. If the organization is unable to report
              exact figures, it can report the number of employees to the
              nearest ten or, where the number of employees is greater than
              1000, to the nearest 100. The number of employees is one indicator
              of the organization’s scale of activity in a tax jurisdiction. In
              addition to the number of employees, the organization may report
              the number of workers (excluding employees) performing the
              organization’s activities, if this helps explain the
              organization’s scale of activity in the jurisdiction. It is
              important that the organization reports the number of employees
              and/or the number of workers consistently across all jurisdictions
              and between time periods.

              These disclosures require the organization to report revenues from
              third-party sales for each tax jurisdiction and from intra-group
              transactions between that jurisdiction and other tax
              jurisdictions. Intra-group transactions within the same tax
              jurisdiction are not required, but the organization can report
              this information separately. Intra-group transactions between
              jurisdictions can influence the tax bases of the organization in
              the jurisdictions involved in these transactions. Intra-group
              transactions within the same tax jurisdiction do not affect the
              tax base of the organization within that jurisdiction. For this
              reason, revenues from third-party sales and intra-group
              transactions with other jurisdictions are a more appropriate
              indicator of an organization’s scale of activity in a tax
              jurisdiction than aggregated revenues. Aggregated revenues could
              result in local revenues being double-counted, which might create
              a misleading impression about the organization's scale of activity
              in a jurisdiction. The organization can also report other sources
              of revenue, for example, dividends, interest, and royalties, where
              this is standard practice in the sector of the organization.

              This disclosure applies to those organizations in which a
              substantial portion of their employees, and workers (excluding
              employees) performing the organization’s activities, are
              compensated in a manner or scale that is closely linked to laws or
              regulations on minimum wage. Providing wages above the minimum
              wage can help contribute to the economic well-being of workers
              performing the organization’s activities. The impacts of wage
              levels are immediate, and they directly affect individuals,
              organizations, countries and economies. The distribution of wages
              is crucial for eliminating inequalities, such as wage gap
              differences between women and men, or nationals and migrants.
              Also, entry level wages paid compared to local minimum wages show
              the competitiveness of an organization’s wages and provide
              information relevant for assessing the effect of wages on the
              local labor market. Comparing this information by gender can also
              be a measure of an organization’s approach to equal opportunity in
              the workplace.
